My talk on the Cost of Kotlin Language Features at [KotlinConf](http://kotlinconf.com) went pretty well I think.

If you missed it, and don't want to wait for it on Netflix, the slides (with speaker notes) are available on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYX8RvspzQVxoGTlyagNqEyFGKIaTObSSz8CjoUpMks).

The thing that impressed me most about the conference? I knew that JetBrains was a company of very clever people; I discovered that they are a company of very nice people. This was I believe their first big event, and they went about it with heart. 

Kudos JetBrains - you deserve success for Kotlin.
