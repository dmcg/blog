"The minutes of the meeting should reflect not what the minister said,
nor what the minister thought he said, but what the minister should have
said had he thought what he was saying."

This is the blog of Duncan McGregor. Duncan has been programming professionally for 25 years. He was lucky enough to ride the Object-Oriented wave of the 90s, the Agile wave of the 00s, and what he is convinced will be called the Distributed-Functional wave of the, erm 10s.

When not writing about himself in the third-person; Duncan codes, runs conference sessions on things that interest him, and throws his money away in entrepreneurial ventures.
